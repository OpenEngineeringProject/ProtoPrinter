Hi, Iâ€™m @OpenEngineeringProject

I am a student at the University of Kentucky who is insterested in developing all sorts of awesome things for fun. Right now, I am working on 3D printers.
If you found me through my Youtube channel, that's great! If you found me through other means, that's great too!
I hope you find what I am working on interesting, and even if you don't make one of my projects yourself, I hope you can use my documentation to make something awesome of your own :D
