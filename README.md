Hi, Iâ€™m @ProtoPrinter

I am a student at the University of Kentucky who is insterested in developing experimental 3D printer for fun.
If you found me through one my posts on Reddit, that's great! If you found me through other means, that's great too!
I hope you find what I am working on interesting, and even if you don't make one of my projects yourself, I hope you can use my documentation to make something awesome of your own :D
